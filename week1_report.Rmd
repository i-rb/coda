In this notebook I am computing the functions that are mentioned in the _Week 1 Report_. When possible, I compare my results with those obtained via the 'compositions' package.

```{r}
library(compositions)
```


## 1.1. First Definitions
### Function 1. Which of these variables are compositional?

This function takes a set of variables in a list (each of them matrices or vectors) and returns a vector of zeros and ones. The component in position _i_, associated to the _i_ position of the input vector, should be one if that matrix add up to a constant value and zero otherwise. This could be adjusted to add up approximately to a constant because of the roundings in transformed variables and so.


```{r}
which_coda=function(l,eps){ # l = list of variables, # eps = allowed error
  result = numeric()
  for (i in l){
    if (is.integer(dim(i)[2])==TRUE){
      range = max(rowSums(i))-min(rowSums(i))
      if (range<=eps){result <- c(result, 1)}
      else{result <- c(result, 0)}
    }
    else{result <- c(result, 0)}
  }
  return(result)
}
```


We are doing a tiny example for a simple vector which cannot be compositional data by definition, a matrix which apparently is a compositional vector and a matrix that is not. 



```{r}
m1 = matrix(c(0.25,0.249999,0.2,0.2))
m1 <- cbind(m1, c(0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.35))
m1 <- cbind(m1, c(0.45, 0.45, 0.5, 0.45)) # definig the comp matrix

m2 = matrix(c(0.25,0.249999,0.2,0.2))
m2 <- cbind(m2, c(0.3, 0.9, 0.3, 0.35))
m2 <- cbind(m2, c(0.45, 0.45, 0.5, 0.65)) # definig the non comp matrix

v1 = c(1,2,2,1) # simple vector
lex = list(v1,m1,m2)
```

Vector:
```{r}
v1
```


Compositional Matrix: 
```{r}
m1
```

Non Compositional Matrix: 
```{r}
m2
```

Results if no deviation for the sum of the components is allowed:
```{r}
which_coda(lex,0)
```

Results if a tiny (0.001) deviation for the sum of the components is allowed:
```{r}
which_coda(lex,0.001)
```


### Function 2. Closed form operator.

This function returns the closed form of a given compositional vector (given as a matrix).

```{r}
C=function(x, k){ # x the matrix of the variable, k the constant (=1 if missing)
  if (missing(k)){
    newx <- (x)/rowSums(x)
    return(newx)
  }
  else{
    newx <- (k*x)/rowSums(x)
    return(newx)
  }
} 
  
```

An example with the previously defined "m2" FOR $k=1$:
```{r}
C(m2)
```

An example with the previously defined "m2" FOR $k=100$:
```{r}
C(m2,100)
```

### Function 3. Naive Ternary plot (from scratch).

Here is the code for plotting ternary diagrams. Its input is a matrix with the compositional data and its output the aforementioned plot. Of course, it is very naive -yet-.

```{r}

ternary=function(mat){ # depends only in the data matrix containing the compositional datA
  x = mat[1,][1]
  y = mat[1,][2]
  z = mat[1,][3]
  p=c(0.5*(2*y+z)/(x+y+z), sqrt(3/2)*(z/(x+y+z)))
  plot(p[1],p[2],xlim=c(0,1),ylim=c(0,1), pch=20,xlab=" ",ylab=" ", cex=0.5)
  if (nrow(mat)>1){
    for (i in 2:nrow(mat)){
    x = mat[i,][1]
    y = mat[i,][2]
    z = mat[i,][3]
    p=c(0.5*(2*y+z)/(x+y+z), sqrt(3/2)*(z/(x+y+z)))
    points(p[1],p[2],pch=20, cex=0.5)
    }
  }
  segments(0,0,1,0)
  segments(0.5,sqrt(3/4),0,0)
  segments(0.5,sqrt(3/4),1,0)
}
```

And here, one example with out 4 row "m2" matrix:

```{r,fig.width=2, fig.height=2}
ternary(m2)
```


I will test the 'compositions' ternary diagram:

```{r}
ac=acomp(m2)
plot(ac)
```

_Surprisingly, it doesn't make that much difference..._

## 1.2.1 The Aitchison Geometry (Operations)
### Function 4. The perturbation.

The perturbation in the Aitchison geometry is defined as $\mathbf{x}\oplus\mathbf{p} = \mathcal{C}[x_1p_1,...,x_Dp_D]$:

```{r}
pt = function (x,y){ # I prefer to keep an easy name for this kind of functions, x and y are matrix 1xD
  return(C(x*y))
}
```


We define $x_1$ and $x_2$ and use the perturbation operation.

```{r}
x1 = t(matrix(c(0.3,2,1,3)))
x2 = t(matrix(c(3,  1,2,4)))

pt(x1,x2)
```

We can see that $x_1 \oplus x_2$ lies in the simplex.
```{r}
sum(pt(x1,x2)) # arreglar PT
```


Here I replicate the example given in the "Transformations" document:

```{r}
pt(t(matrix(c(1,2,3))),t(matrix(c(1,2,1))))
```



### Function 5. The powering.

The powering function is defined by  $\lambda \odot \mathbf{x} = \mathcal{C}[x_1^\lambda,...,x_D^\lambda]$. 

```{r}
pw=function(l,x){ # x the vector (matrix 1xD) and l stands for the scalar
  return(C(x**l))
}
```

As an example, $2\odot x_1$, which should coincide with $x_1\oplus x_1$:

```{r}
pw(2,x1) # powering
```

```{r}
pt(x1,x1) # perturbation
```

... and  the "transformations" document example:

```{r}
pw(2,t(matrix(c(1,2,1)))) # perturbationx
```



### Function 6. The Aitchison inner product.

The inner product of this geometry is defined as: $\langle \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \rangle_A = \dfrac{1}{D} \sum_{i=1}^{D-1}\sum_{j=i+1}^{D} \ln\dfrac{x_i}{x_j}\ln\dfrac{y_i}{y_j}$. 

```{r}
inner = function(x,y){ # x, y are Dx1 matrices
  result = 0
  D = ncol(x)
  for (i in (1:(D-1))){
    result <- result + sum(log(x[i]/x[(i+1):D])*(log(y[i]/y[(i+1):D])))
  }
  return((1/D)*result)
}
```

Thus, $\langle x_1,x_2 \rangle=-0.26672$

```{r}
inner(x1,x2)
```


### Function 7. The Aitchison distance.

The distance is defined as $d_A(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}) = \left(\dfrac{1}{D} \sum_{i=1}^{D-1}\sum_{j=i+1}^{D} \left(\ln\dfrac{x_i}{x_j}-\ln\dfrac{y_i}{y_j}\right)^2\right)^{1/2}$

```{r}
dist = function(x,y){ # x,y 1xD matrices
  result = 0
  D = ncol(x)
  for (i in (1:(D-1))){
    result <- result + sum((log(x[i]/x[(i+1):D])-(log(y[i]/y[(i+1):D])))**2)
  }
  return(((1/D)*result)**(1/2))
}
```

As any distance, $d_A(x_1,x_1)$ should be equal to 0 and positive otherwise:

```{r}
dist(x1,x1)
dist(x1,x2)
```

I cannot get the equality between norm(x-y) and distance(x,y), despite it is stated in the page (p.41) of the transformations document (maybe **only a feature of the 'compositions' package**? Yes! That is!). Empirically, I even get an error because $z:=x-y$ has positive and negative components and, therefore, $ln(z_i/z_j)$ should be calculated and $\exists\; i,j$ such that $z_i\cdot z_j<0$ 

```{r}
dist(x1,x2)
sqrt(inner(x1-x2,x1-x2))

x1c = acomp(x1)   
x2c = acomp(x2)
norm(x1c-x2c) # composition package norm
```



### Function 8. Linear operator.

The linear operator is defined as $A\boxdot\mathbf{x} = \mathcal{C}\left(\prod_{j=1}^D x_j^{a_{1j}},...,\prod_{j=1}^D x_j^{a_{Dj}}\right)^T$ for $A$ a DxD matrix and $x$ a 1xD vector.

```{r}
lin = function (A, x){ # A matrix, x vector 1xD
  vec=numeric()
  for (i in 1:nrow(A)){
    vec=c(vec,prod(x[i]**A[i,]))
  }
  return(C(t(vec)))
}
```

Here the function is tested:

```{r}
  v3=matrix(c(0.4,0.2,0.4)) # defining a vector
  m3 = matrix(c(0.4,0.4,0.3))
  m3 <- cbind(m3, c(0.3,0.1,0.3)) # defining a square matrix
  m3 <- cbind(m3, c(0.2,0.5,0.4)) 
  lin(m3,v3)
```



## 1.2.2 The Aitchison Geometry (Transformations)
### Function 9. The alr transfomration.
The alr transformation is given by: $\mathrm{alr}(\mathbf{x})=(\ln(x_1/x_D),...,\ln(x_{D-1}/x_D))$

```{r}
alr = function(x,i){   # x is a 1xD matrix, i an integer in (1,D): the "reference" element
  if (missing(i)){     # if i is not given, the last element is used 
    return(log(x/x[length(x)])[-length(x)])
  }
  else{
    return(log(x/x[i])[-i])
  }
}
```

For example, the transformation for $x_1$:

```{r}
alr(x1)
```

And it coincides with the result of the 'compositions' package:

```{r}
compositions::alr(x1)[1,]
```


### Function 10. The ilr transformation.

The ilr transformation is given by:

$\mathrm{ilr}(\mathbf{x})=\mathbf{V}^T_D\ln(\mathbf{x}):=x^*$

For the 3-component case (the function should be extended if needed), the matrix $\mathbf{V}_3$ is given by: $\mathbf{V}_3 = \left( \begin{matrix} \sqrt\frac{2}{3} & 0 \\ -\frac{1}{\sqrt6} & \frac{1}{\sqrt2} \\ -\frac{1}{\sqrt6} & -\frac{1}{\sqrt2}\end{matrix}\right)$

```{r}
ilr = function(x){ # x matrix 1xD as always (deprecated)
  V3 = matrix(c(sqrt(2/3),-sqrt(1/6),-sqrt(1/6)))
  V3 <- cbind(V3, c(0,sqrt(1/2),-sqrt(1/2))) # defining V3
  return(t(V3)%*%log(x))
}
```

Here, the alr transformation is used for a new vector $x_3$:

```{r}
x3=c(0.4,0.2,0.4)
ilr(x3)
```


### Function 11. The ilr inverse.

For this, the exponential of a matrix is needed. I will compute a naive Taylor-series based one (in order to avoid using external packages for the moment):

```{r}
expm = function(M, iter){ # matrix and number of iterations (the more the better)
  if (missing(iter)){     # if i is not given, the last element is used 
    iter=100
  }
  res=diag(length(M[1,]))
  power=M
  for (i in 1:iter){
    res = res + power/factorial(i)
    power = power%*%M
  }
  return(res)
}
```

It works quite well!
```{r} 
test1 <- t(matrix(c(4, 2, 0,1, 4, 1,1, 1, 4), 3, 3))
expm(test1,100)
```

Of course, this was not needed. I did not realise the dimensions.

Now, the inverse ilr (only for the D=3 case): $x=\mathrm{ilr}^{-1}(\mathbf{x}^*) = \mathcal{C}(\exp(\mathbf{V}_D x^*)$ 

```{r}
inverseilr=function(x){ # x is x*, vec of coordinates
  V3 = matrix(c(sqrt(2/3),-sqrt(1/6),-sqrt(1/6)))
  V3 <- cbind(V3, c(0,sqrt(1/2),-sqrt(1/2))) # defining V3
  return(C(t((exp(V3%*%x)))))
}
```



Testing the new function for $x_3$, we should have $\mathrm{ilr}^{-1}(\mathrm{ilr(\mathbf{x})})=\mathbf{x}$. Perfect! _(there was a bug in previous versions, I forgot a "log" somewhere)_

```{r}
x3
```

```{r}
inverseilr(ilr(x3))
```


Now that I have read in the transformations document the explicit formula of $\mathbf{V}$ I can make a function to compute it here:

```{r}
V_D = function(D){ # D is the dimension (parts)
  V_D = matrix(0L, nrow =D , ncol = D-1)
  for (i in 1:(D-1)){  # pseudodiagonal elements
    V_D[i,i] = (D-i)/(sqrt((D-i+1)*(D-i)))
  }
  for (i in 2:D){ # below pseudodiagonal elements
    for (j in 1:i-1){
      V_D[i,j]=-1/(sqrt((D-j+1)*(D-j)))
    }
  } 
  return(V_D)
}
```

The matrix $V_3$ had been computed previously. It is checked that they coincide:

```{r}
V3 = matrix(c(sqrt(2/3),-sqrt(1/6),-sqrt(1/6)))
V3 <- cbind(V3, c(0,sqrt(1/2),-sqrt(1/2))) # defining V3 as before
V3

V_D(3) # our brand new function
```

Now, it is possible to update the ilr function:

```{r}
ilr = function(x){ # x matrix N x D
  x = C(x)
  V = V_D(dim(x)[2])
  return(t(t(V)%*%t(log(x))))
}
```


```{r}
testvec = t(matrix(c(1,2,4)))
ilr(testvec)
```

However... (I can assume the first and the second coordinates are interchangables, and also that (x,y), (-x, -y) are equivalent representations, but...). I have found that the 'compositions' package what does here is $\mathrm{ilr}(x) = V^T \mathrm{clr}(x)$.

```{r}
ac = acomp(c(1,2,4))

compositions::ilr(ac)
```


## 1.3. Regressions

The good news is that the ilr transformation defined previously works with (the transpose of) matrices; the bad is that the regression cannot be done yet (remark that both the independent and dependent variables could be matrices). 

```{r}
ilr(t(m2))
```

## 1.4. Descriptive Analysis of Compositional Data

### Function 12. The _compositional mean_.

The compositional mean of a variable $\mathbf{x}$ is given by:

**EQUÍ EMPOBINAR L'ECUACION**


```{r}
c_mean=function(x){ #x is a matrix NxD
  mult = t(matrix(x[1,]))
  for (i in (2:(dim(x)[1]))){
    mult=pt(mult,t(matrix(x[i,])))
  }
  res = pw(1/dim(x)[1], mult)
  return(res)
}
```

For example:

```{r}
c_mean(m1)
```

And it coincides with the 'compositions' package mean:

```{r}
mean(acomp(m1))
```
